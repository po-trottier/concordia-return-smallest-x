# Return Smallest X Algorithm

This algorithm returns the smallest *x* elements of an array (sorted) by using no library calls other than for the print statement. 

It has a horrible time complexity but an auxiliary space complexity of O(n).

**This algorithm was developed as part of the *Data Structures and Algorithms* course given at Concordia University.**
